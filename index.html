            The ethos and the values of Kupe House have developed from the Kupe legend, with emphasis given to the idea of making a voyage and returning home to share the benefits and value of the findings with his/her people. All Kupe students and staff are committed to this journey and to sharing knowledge and skills to improve all of Kupe House. This is a house full of explorers and adventurers, a house full of promise and highly motivated young people. There is a real sense of whānau (family) in this house, fostered by hard working staff and students, all on whom enjoy being part of a warm, caring atmosphere where they are supported and encouraged to strive for excellence in everything they do. 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step' and in Kupe we take that first step together.
